# SirRailOfGun's Alpha Frontier Civs


An mod for AlphaFrontier that adds some new civilizations based on sci-fi/sci-fan properties I felt weren't represented yet, or ideas I thought were fun.

Civs are:

Blood Cult - a religion based combat civ, themed around things like Warhammer's Khorne or SS13's cult mode
