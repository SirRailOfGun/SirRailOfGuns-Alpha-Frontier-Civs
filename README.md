# SirRailOfGun's Alpha Frontier Civs


An mod for AlphaFrontier that adds some new civilizations based on sci-fi/sci-fan properties I felt weren't represented yet, or ideas I thought were fun.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Civs are:

Blood Cult - a religion based combat civ, themed around things like Warhammer's Khorne or SS13's cult mode

Earth Defense Force - Instead of nation-wide effects, the EDF has 8 unique units: The Ranger, Wing Diver, Air Raider, and Fencer are their main units, with the Bluejackets, Spriggans, and Grim Reapers as mercenary versions. There is no mercenary Air Raider. Instead, the nuclear satelite is replaced with Spritefall, an uncounterable orbital laser weapon.
